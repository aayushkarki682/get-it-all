# get-it-all
*Just a simple attempt to make a website using spring boot, java, hibernate, html, bootstrap, css and javascript* 😁  


### *Trying to make a simple web application where user can*     
* login and post status and images.
* User can also look other user posts   
* User would be able to like and comment on posts **remaining  
* User would also be able to send the friend request **remaining  

## Since we are solely focusing on back end web development and this is a fresh start  
We will be focusing solely on back end. After successful completion, front end will have all our time  
*But anybody interested in doing UI can feel free to do it. I would really love and appreciate it* 😉

## I would recommend forking this repository so that later on it would be easy to merge codes
